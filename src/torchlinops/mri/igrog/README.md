# Implicit GROG Backends
Mark Nishimura
February 2024

There are two possible backends to use to estimate implicit GROG kernels from calibration data:

1. My custom implmementation (found in `_backend`)
2. The official implementation (found in `_igrog`), which requires that the appropriate submodule in `libraries/igrog` be installed and up-to-date.
